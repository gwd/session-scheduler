<p>Design sessions are one of the most fruitful aspects of XenSummit.
Anyone can propose a topic, even as the conference is going on, and
interested people can get together to discuss it and hash out solutions.</p>

<p>However, scheduling them so that everyone has the opportunity to go
to the sessions they'd like to is difficult.  In the past this was
done with post-it notes on a whiteboard.  This year, we're trying
something new.</p>

<p>The basic idea is:
<ul>
  <li>Anyone who wants to <a href="discussion/new">proposes</a> a
  topic</li>
  <li>Everyone goes through the <a href="list/discussion">list of
  sessions</a> and says how much they would like to attend</li>
  <li>The session scheduler looks for a <a href="schedule">schedule</a> which maximizes
  people's preferences</li>
</ul>

  <li>All new accounts are marked <em>unverified</em> at creation.  All
  proposals added or edited by unverified accounts will be marked
  "non-public", visible only to the owners and site admins, until
  approved by admins.  Once conference registration is complete, we
  will be sending out a code you can use to "verify" your account; at
  that point, no more unverified accounts can be created.</li>
