This is here mainly as a placeholder to create the directory.

There should be three files here:

 1. serverconfig.sqlite: Contains configuration related to the webserver
 2. sessions.sqlite: Active logged-in web sessions.  Delete this to log everyone out.
 3. event.sqlite: Core information about the event: users, discussions, schedule, etc.
